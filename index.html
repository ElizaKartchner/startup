        <h2>Here's a little about me:</h2>
        <p>
          I am a junior majoring in bioinformatics at Brigham Young University. 
          Just got married last year to the love of my life, Levi Homer. We are 
          both very busy with school and work but in our free time we like to watch 
          shows and movies, go exploring outside, play lots of board and card games, 
          and make food. I have recently been showing my husband that Indian food 
          is really yummy. Personally, I like to go running and read when I have the time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I served my mission in Romania. I want to go back and visit. I miss the covrgi.  
          It’s like a giant pretzel that is filled with Nutella. In case you are wondering 
          how to say hello in Romanian, it is “Buna Ziua!”
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to take CS 260 because I wanted to learn how to create a website. 
          In CS 240 we created an application that had user interface and I enjoyed 
          making a way people can interact with code. With bioinformatics I want to 
          create tools to solve biological problems that scientists can use.  Having 
          a nice interface allows others to use those tools more readily.

          Have you ever struggled to come up with a data idea? Maybe you googled data 
          ideas and found lists out there that are pages and pages long! How do you know 
          if one of those many ideas is even a good one? If you want to know if a restaurant 
          is good there are many websites you can look up and see the reviews people who 
          have eaten there have said. If you want to see if a professor is good, you can 
          go to ratemyProfessor.com and see how many stars they have as well as the good 
          and bad things about their classes. Why not do the same thing for data ideas?!
          Whether you're single and want to impress your new love interest, in a serious 
          relationship and ready to pop the question, or married and want to create a 
          special anniversary or just spice up the normal night date this website is for you. 
          Here people can submit data ideas and others can post reviews. Each dating idea 
          will have a rating out of five stars and want others to have to say about it. 
          This way you can be informed and plan the best dates to romance your significant other.
