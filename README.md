Startup assignment for CS 260 Web Development 

This is the repo I will be using for CS 260 and my start up application. I am excited to learn more about Web Development! 

I am modifying the README.md file from VS code! Yay! 
I am now modifying the README.md file from GitHub! Woohoo! 

I am changing this line... I am changing this line from VS code... and fixing the merge issue...

Notes about the GitHub assignment:

This is the classic github use patten to follow. 
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code (Eliza's note: MAKE SURE TO SAVE IN VS CODE AFTER CHANGING THE CODE!)
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

- Merging conflicts are annoying to fix but it is possible. The best thing to do is to be careful
and not create such conflicts 
- I created a personal access token. To create another one go to settings >> developer settings >> personal access token. Then follow the steps there.

I now have a domain name that is associated with my IP address. It is darlingDateReviews.click. 
I have a record representing your root domain name and a wild card subdomain so I can access my website with 
my domain name and any subdomain name such as startup.darlingDateReviews.click

Caddy acts as a gateway to our different services and to host our static web application files. 
Caddy has ACME support built into it by default. We used Caddy to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for you domain name.

# simon notes html
It is important to test your files before you deploy them to your production environment. 
As I was creating the simon html files, I noticed that they all had the same footer and the same header. Within the header each file contained the 
navigation elements allowing the user to go from page to page. 

# simon notes css
It is best to use a combination of bootstrap and css selectors and declarations. 
CSS makes our application visually appealing and adds intuitive user interface elements, but it is still not functional due to the lack of interactivity. 
How to refer to a CSS file for a HTML file using a link element. 
```html

# HTML Notes 
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. 
HTML elements are represented with enclosing tags that may enclose other elements or text. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. 

# CSS Notes
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive, experience.
A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
How to associate CSS with HTML
1. use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
2. use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document
3. use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. Make appear in the head element of the document. 

CSS defines everything as boxes.
![CSS box model](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplilearn.com%2Ftutorials%2Fcss-tutorial%2Fcss-box-model&psig=AOvVaw3AENWOUmJEnV4t_89GoDjw&ust=1677018249930000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCMi4jvmRpf0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

Different ways to add color to CSS: keyword, RGB hex, RGB function, HSL.

There are four major families of fonts: `Serif`, `san-serif`, `fixed`, and `symbol`. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes, san-serif fonts do not.


## JavaScript Notes 
Officially known as ECMAScript. Typically JavaScript is executed using an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time. This has the advantage of making JavaScript very portable, but also allows for many errors, such as using an undefined variable. These types of errors commonly only get discovered when the program crashes during execution.
The JavaScript console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console.
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2

How to add JavaScript to HTML:  You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element, or using by the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.
  
Variables are declared using either the `let` or `const` keyword. `let` allows you to change the value of the variable while `const` will cause an error if you attempt to change it. JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometime the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are use to strongly typed languages.
  
JavaScript uses complex rules for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as falsy and truthy evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.
  
# JSON 
JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.
  
JSON document can contain these datatype: string, number, boolean, array, object, or null. Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square braces and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.
  
You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.
```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);
```
  
# JavaScript regular expressions (textual pattern mathcers) 
You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```
The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```
  
# JavaScript Rest and Spread 
`rest` syntax allows you to make the last parameter of the function take as many things and combine them into an array. Provides variadic functions. 
```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```
Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following example.
  
```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

# JavaScript Destructuring
 Destructuring is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.
  
Example one
```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
  
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```
When object destructuring, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object. You can map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.
  
```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

# JavaScript Exceptions
  An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the throw keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime. A finally block that is always called whenever the try block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown. Restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations, do not use as a way to handle normal flows of execution. Fallback pattern: you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.
 
```js
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

# JavaScript Scope 
Scope is the variables that are visible in the current context of execution. There are four different types. 
1. **Gobal** - Visible to all code
1. **Module** - Visible to all code running in a module
1. **Function** - Visible within a function
1. **Block** - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces
Closure = a function and its surrounding state. 

## This

The keyword `this` represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The `this` variable is automatically declared and you can reference `this` anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of `this` depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different context that this can refer to:

1. **Global** - When `this` is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the `globalThis` object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
1. **Function** - When `this` is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running is JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
1. **Object** - When `this` is referenced in a object it refers to the object.

## modules
JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules.

# Document Object Model (DOM) 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML. The browser provides access to the DOM through a global variable name document that points to the root element of the DOM. For everything in an HTML document there is a node in the DOM. This includes elements, attributes, text, comments, and whitespace. All of these nodes form a big tree, with the document node at the top.

# Promises
JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.
The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.
The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

```js
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));

// OUTPUT:
//    Coin toss result: tails
//    Toss completed
```
# Async and await 
  
These functions provide a more concise representation then promises. The `await` keyword wraps the execution of a promise and removed the need to chain functions. The `await` expression will block until the promise state moves to `fulfilled`, or throws an exception if the state moves to `rejected`. One important restriction for working with `await` is that you cannot call await unless it is called at the top level of the JavaScript, or is in a function that is defined with the `async` keyword. Applying the `async` keyword transforms the function so that it returns a promise that will resolve to the value that was previously returned by the function. Basically this turns any function into an asynchronous function, so that it can in turn make asynchronous requests.

**async, try/catch version**

```js
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
```
  
## await

The `async` keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The `await` keyword wraps a call to the `async` function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise.
By combining async, to define functions that return promises, with await, to wait on the promise, you can create code that is asynchronous, but still maintains the flow of the code without explicitly using callbacks.
