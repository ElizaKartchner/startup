Startup assignment for CS 260 Web Development 

This is the repo I will be using for CS 260 and my start up application. I am excited to learn more about Web Development! 

I am modifying the README.md file from VS code! Yay! 
I am now modifying the README.md file from GitHub! Woohoo! 

I am changing this line... I am changing this line from VS code... and fixing the merge issue...

Notes about the GitHub assignment:

This is the classic github use patten to follow. 
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code (Eliza's note: MAKE SURE TO SAVE IN VS CODE AFTER CHANGING THE CODE!)
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

- Merging conflicts are annoying to fix but it is possible. The best thing to do is to be careful
and not create such conflicts 
- I created a personal access token. To create another one go to settings >> developer settings >> personal access token. Then follow the steps there. 

Elevator pitch for start-up
