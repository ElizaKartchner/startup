# startup
Startup assignment for CS 260 Web Development 

This is the repo I will be using for CS 260 and my start up application. I am excited to learn more about Web Development! 

I am modifying the README.md file from VS code! Yay! 
I am now modifying the README.md file from GitHub! Woohoo! 

I am changing this line... I am changing this line from VS code... and fixing the merge issue...

Notes about the GitHub assignment:

This is the classic github use patten to follow. 
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code (Eliza's note: MAKE SURE TO SAVE IN VS CODE AFTER CHANGING THE CODE!)
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

- Merging conflicts are annoying to fix but it is possible. The best thing to do is to be careful
and not create such conflicts 
- I created a personal access token. To create another one go to settings >> developer settings >> personal access token. Then follow the steps there.

The midterm covers basic console commands, internet concepts (HTTP, DNS, web certs), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Intro to web programming
How to be an exceptional web programmer
- Tech = find right tool for the job, maximize its performance, and automate its execution.
- Art = visually attractive web application and well written code
- Social = teams to work together and interact with customers 
- Discovery = Having a mind that is always questioning 
Making mistakes is a key component for learning. Recognizing and embracing the power of making mistakes will help you learn faster, and at a deeper level. 

## A brief history of web programming
1. The formation of the internet that supports the communication of web applications
1. The creation of HTML and HTTP that made it possible to shared hyperlinked documents (Web 1.0).
1. The creation of CSS and JavaScript that enabled interactive web applications (Web 2.0).

## The Internet 
United States Department of Defense created the ARPANET as a means of sharing information between universities doing defense related research.
The management of the Internet is controlled by two major organizations. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines the technical standards that specify how the physical network communicates. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees both the Internet Protocol (IP) address space, and the Domain Name System (DNS).

## HTML = Hypertext Markup Language 
Tim Berners-Lee was tasked with building a system that would allow researchers to share documents between remote academic institutions. ARPANET provided the necessary connectivity, Berners-Lee defined the protocols for document sharing. Named the document format the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) based on inspiration from the digital publishing industry's Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). Documents could be interconnected with what he termed hyperlinks to allow immediate access to related documents. Berners-Lee also made contributions to HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). These two definitions specify how web documents are addressed and transmitted across the Internet. 

## CSS = Cascading Style Sheets 
First proposed in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie, a contemporary of Berners-Lee at CERN, in order to give HTML documents visual styling independent of the content's structure. By 1996 CSS became a standard and all the major browsers began to implement the functionality.

## JavaScript 
Added the ability to script web pages turning the static web into an interactive experience. "Always bet on JS" - Brendan Eich

### Technology stack
The collection of technologies that you use to create or deliver you web application is called a technology stack. it is a stack because they usually layer one on top of each other. 

## The Console 
Also know as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. You can see which directory you are in with the `pwd` (present working directory). You can list all of the files in the directory with ls (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, `ls` can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter `-la`. command.

### Executing commands 
The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. Here are some basic commands you should know and will come to love. 
- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Output the contents of a file
- **less** - Interactively output the contents of a file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - Take the output from the command on the left and _pipe_, or pass, it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command

The better you get at working with the console the more efficient your programming will be. If I ever want to experiment with console commands... Open a console window and create a junk directory that you can play with by executing the command `mkdir junk` (make directory). Then execute the command `cd junk` to change into that directory. Try the following sequence of commands:

```sh
mkdir junk
cd junk
pwd
ls
ls -la
ls ../
echo "hello world" > test.txt
ls -l
cat test.txt
cp test.txt other.txt
ls
cat test.txt >> other.txt
less other.txt # press `q` to exit less
rm test.txt
ls
cd ..
ls
rm -rf junk
ls
```

### Editors 
The code editor is the workspace of a web application developer. Deeply learning an editor that makes you efficient and flexible will pay significant dividends in your ability to deliver quality work and greatly reduce frustration. A good editor should feel like a friend. If you are constantly arguing with your editor, then perhaps you need a relationship adjustment.

## VI aka VIM 
VI, or technically vim, is one of the oldest console editors. It is extremely powerful and some incredibly talented software engineers use it as their sole development environment. The reason why you should learn VI is that it is available on every Linux server and can do anything that you will need. VI works entirely by keyboard commands. There are two modes in VI, command mode and insert mode. When you open VI, you are in command mode and all of the command keystrokes will work. To edit a document, use the command `i` to enter insert mode. Now your keystrokes will modify the document. To exit insert mode and type commands again, press `ESC`.

The following short list of commands should allow you to do most of what you will ever want to do. Here is a [cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/) if you want to see all the commands.

# GIT 
Incredibly Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, was fed up with the proprietary version control software that he was using to track the code for the Linux kernel and so over a weekend he built Git, the world's most popular version control system. Git provides two valuable functions. First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer. 

## What is Git?

Git provides two valuable functions. First, it allows you to track versions of files in a directory. Second, it allows you to clone all of those versions to a different location, usually to a different computer. We are going to focus on tracking versions in this instruction and cover cloning repositories when we talk later about GitHub.

You can track file versions of any files in a directory by initializing Git for that directory. You can do this right now by creating a new directory in a console window and initializing it as a Git repository.

```sh
➜  mkdir playingWithGit
➜  cd playingWithGit
➜  git init
```

If you list all files in the directory you will see that you now have a hidden directory named `.git`.

```sh
➜  ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 lee  staff    96 Dec  1 22:59 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 54 lee  staff  1728 Dec  1 23:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x   9 lee  staff   288 Dec  1 22:59 .git
```

The `.git` directory is where all of the versions get stored. Now use the `echo` command to create a file so that we can see how versioning works. After creating the new file, use `git status` to tell you what git is doing.

```sh
➜ echo hello world > hello.txt
➜ git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git status tells you that it detects a new file named `hello.txt`, but it isn't currently tracking versions for that file. To begin tracking versions you need to add it. Usually you track all files in a repository directory and so you can tell Git to track everything that it doesn't know about with `git add .`. Follow this with another call to `git status`.

```sh
➜  git add .
➜  git status

On branch master
No commits yet
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   hello.txt
```

Now Git tells us that it has `staged` the file `hello.txt` and it is ready to be committed as a version in the repository. We commit a version with the `commit` command. We always want to have a meaningful comment about the version we are committing and so we use the `-m` parameter to provide a message that will live with the version. Follow this with another call to `git status`.

```sh
➜  git commit -m "initial draft"
[master (root-commit) d43b07b] initial draft
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt

➜  git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Congratulations! You have just committed your first file to a Git repository. It is important to note that we were only working with a single file in this example. However, a commit can represent multiple files. You just need to add them all before you execute the commit. Also, note that the point of the stage (add) step, is so that you can commit some files while still leaving other modified file out of the commit.

Let's make an edit to our file and commit it again. This time we will tell Git that we want to add all the tracked modified files to our commit by including the `-a` parameter along with our message parameter.

```sh
➜  echo goodbye world > hello.txt

➜  git commit -am "changed greeting to reflect the present mood"

[master e65f983] changed greeting to reflect the present mood
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Now that we have a couple versions in our repository we can view the versions with the `git log` command.

```sh
➜  git log

commit e65f9833ca8ee366d0d9c1676a91b1a977dab441 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:32:22 2022 -0700

    changed greeting to reflect the present mood

commit d43b07b8890f52defb31507211ba78785bf6dccf
Author: Lee
Date:   Thu Dec 1 23:29:11 2022 -0700

    initial draft
```

This shows both commits with the associated comments.

## Commit SHA

Every commit has a unique identifier that is generated by hashing the file along with the timestamp using the SHA hashing algorithm. You can always refer to a specific commit in your version history by using its SHA. For example, if we want to temporarily switch back to a previous version to see what it contains we can use the `checkout` command. You only need to provide the first few characters of the SHA.

```sh
➜  git checkout d43b07b8890f

Note: switching to 'd43b07b8890f'.
HEAD is now at d43b07b initial draft

➜  cat hello.txt
hello world
```

The above output omits a big message saying that you are no longer looking at the latest version, but the important thing is that you can see that we are now looking at our old version. To get back to the top of the version chain, use the `checkout` command and reference the branch name, which is by default `master`.

```sh
➜  git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was d43b07b initial draft
Switched to branch 'master'

➜  cat hello.txt
goodbye world
```

Now we are back to our latest version.

The following diagram shows how your commits move from your working directory, to staging them for a commit, and then committing them to a repository.

![Git stage](essentialsGitStage.jpg)

A commit is a full snapshot of what was staged from your directory at the time of the commit. That means all of the files contained in the commit were reverted when you executed the checkout command. Since we only had one file in our commit, it looks like we are only flipping that file around, but basically you can think of it as a time machine for the entire directory.

## Diff

Most of the time you don't want to reverse back to an earlier commit. Instead you just want to compare the differences between commits. We can do that with the `diff` command. You can specify two SHAs that you would like to compare, or you can use the HEAD variable which points to the top of the commit change. To refer to earlier commits you just add `~` and the numerical distance from head that you want to reference. In this case we will compare HEAD and HEAD~1.

```sh
➜  git diff HEAD HEAD~1
```

```diff
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index 3b18e51..eeee2af 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-hello world
+goodbye world
```

You can see that we made a change to `hello.txt` by removing `hello world` and adding `goodbye world`.

## Branches

Git supports the ability to branch your code. This allows you to work on variations of the code while still allowing progress on the main branch. For example, if you wanted to work on a new feature named `A` without interrupting work on the master branch, you would use the `git branch A` command and start working on the `A` branch with the `git checkout A` command. Now commits can be down to both the master and the `A` branch. When you want to combine the work done on both branches you us checkout the master branch and execute `git merge A`. If you decide you want to abandon the new feature then you just don't ever merge it back into the master branch.

## Binary files

You can store any type of file in Git, but be aware that if you store large binary files, such as images or videos, you are storing a copy of that file each time you make a change to it. For example, suppose you use Git to track the changes you make to a video production project. Every time you save a change to your 10 GB video file you store a complete copy of the file. That means 10 commits of the video file will store 100 GB of data in your repository.

# GitHub 
Since its beginning as a simple web application for cloning and storing Git repositories, GitHub has added functionality for hosting websites, supporting community pull requests, tracking issues, hosting codespaces, running continuous deployment processes, managing projects, and even AI driven code generation. It is always easier to create your repository first on GitHub and then clone it to your development environment. That way your repositories are automatically linked to each other.

Every repository in GitHub has a unique URL assigned to it. Assuming the repository is public, anyone with the URL can clone it to their development environment. A repository clone is an exact copy of the repository including all of the commits, comments, and SHAs. It also configures the clone to know what the remote source is so that you can use Git commands to keep them in sync as changes are made.

This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process.

1. See the status of your repository (`git status`)
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (`git pull`)
1. Make changes to the code
1. Add the changes (`git add myfile`)
1. Commit the changes (`git commit`)
1. Push the changes to GitHub (`git push`)

The first time you make a push request to a repository Git will ask you how you want to identify yourself and what credential (e.g. password) to use in order to authenticate with GitHub. You will need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and provide that as your password.

### Development and production environments 
When working on a commercial web application, it is critical to separate where you develop your application, from where the production release of your application is made publicly available. Often times there are more environments than this, such as staging, internal testing, and external testing environments. For my work, I will use and manage both my development (your personal computer) and production (your AWS server) environments.

You run a deployment script from a console window in your development environment with a command like the following.

```sh
./deployService.sh -k ~/prod.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
```

The `-k` parameter provide the credential file necessary to access your production environment. The `-h` parameter is the domain name of your production environment. The `-s` parameter represents the name of the application you are deploying (either `simon` or `startup`).

`ssh` = secure shell program 
`scp` = secure copy program 

# The internet
The internet globally connects independent networks and computing devices. In a simplistic way, you can think of the internet as a massive redundant collection of wires that connect up all the computers in the world. A lot of those wires are wireless (wiFi, satellite, or cell), and not all of computers in the world are connected, but generally that is what the internet is. The deeper your mental model of the internet is, the more effectively you will be able to create web applications.

When one device wants to talk to another it must have an IP address. Usually, human users prefer a symbolic name over an IP address. The symbolic name is called a domain name. Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS). You can look up the IP address for any domain name using the `dig` console utility.

Once you have the IP address, you connect to the device it represents by first asking for a connection route to the device. A connection route consists of many hops across the network until the destination is dynamically discovered and the connection established. With the connection the transport and application layers start exchanging data. You can determine the hops in a connection using the `traceroute` console utility.

### Network internals

The actual sending of data across the internet uses the TCP/IP model. This is a layered architecture that covers everything from the physical wires to the data that a web application sends. At the top of the TCP/IP protocol is the application layer. It represents user functionality, such as the web (HTTP), mail (SMTP), files (FTP), remote shell (SSH), and chat (IRC). Underneath that is the transport layer which breaks the application layer's information into small chunks and sends the data. The actual connection is made using the internet layer. This finds the device you want to talk to and keeps the connection alive. Finally, at the bottom of the model is the link layer which deals with the physical connections and hardware.

#### [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) layers

| Layer       | Example         | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Application | HTTPS           | Functionality like web browsing       |
| Transport   | TCP             | Moving connection information packets |
| Internet    | IP              | Establishing connections              |
| Link        | Fiber, hardware | Physical connections                  |

# Web servers 
A web server is a computing device that is hosting a web service that knows how to accept incoming internet connections and speak the HTTP application protocol.

### Web service gateways 
Since it is so easy to build web services it is common to find multiple web services running on the same computing device. The trick is exposing the multiple services in a way that a connection can be made to each of them. Every network device allows for separate network connections by referring to a unique port number. To resolve this we introduce a service gateway, or sometimes called a reverse proxy, that is itself a simple web service that listens on the common HTTP port 443. The gateway then looks at the request and maps it to the other services running on a different ports.

# AWS (Amazon Web Services) notes 
My server IP address is http://18.119.93.245/
In order to romote shell into my server, the command is ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
I now have a domain name that is associated with my IP address. It is darlingDateReviews.click. 
I have a record representing your root domain name and a wild card subdomain so I can access my website with 
my domain name and any subdomain name such as startup.darlingDateReviews.click

Caddy acts as a gateway to our different services and to host our static web application files. 
Caddy has ACME support built into it by default. We used Caddy to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for you domain name.

When you rent a web server, it is physically located in a massive data center located in a place like Virginia, Ohio, Dublin, or Tokyo. Think of a data center as a very secure, climate controlled, warehouse that has hundreds of thousands of computers sitting in massive racks.

You can stop your server at any time. Don't confuse this with terminating your server which completely destroys it. Stopping your server just powers down the device. This is nice because you don't have to pay for it while it is stopped. However, every time you stop and start your server, it will be assigned a new public IP address. It is important to keep the same public IP address so that you, and others, can always browse to the same place. More importantly, when you create your domain name, you can assign it to an address that never changes.

You have two choices in order to keep the same public IP address: One: Never stop your server. Two: Assign an elastic IP address to your server so that it keeps the same address even if you stop it.

## Domain Names
A domain name is simply a text string that follows a specific naming convention and is listed in a special database called the domain name registry.

Domain names are broken up into a root domain, with one or more possible subdomain prefixes. The root domain is represented by a secondary level domain and a top level domain. The top level domain (TLD) represent things like com, edu, or click. So a root domain would look something like byu.edu, google.com, or cs260.click. The possible list of TLDs is controlled by ICANN, one of the governing boards of the internet.

Which is the following is a DNS subdomain? CS260.cs.byu.edu (the entire thing is the subdomain) 
The owner of a root domain can create any number of subdomains off the root domain. Each subdomain may resolve to a different IP address. You can get information about a domain name from the domain name registry using the `whois` console utility. Every DNS server in the world references a few special DNS servers that are considered the `authoritative name servers` for associating a domain name with an IP address.

The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the `address` (`A`) and the `canonical name` (`CNAME`) records. An `A` record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A `CNAME` record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map `byu.com` to the same IP address as `byu.edu` so that either one could be used.

When you enter a domain name into a browser, the browser first checks to see if it has the name already in its cache of names. If it does not, it contacts a DNS server and gets the IP address. The DNS server also keeps a cache of names. If the domain name is not in the cache, it will request the name from an `authoritative name server`. If the authority does not know the name then you get an unknown domain name error. If the process does resolve, then the browser makes the HTTP connection to the associated IP address.

As you can see, there is a lot of levels of name caching. This is done for performance reasons, but it also can be frustrating when you are trying to update the information associated with your domain name. This is where the `time to live` (`TTL`) setting for a domain record comes into play. You can set this to be something short like 5 minutes or as long as several days. The different caching layers should then honor the TTL and clear their cache after the requested period has passed.

You can pay to lease an unused domain name for a specific period of time. Before the lease expires, you have the right to extend the lease for an additional amount of time. The cost to buy the domain varies from something like $3 to $200 a year. Buying, or sub-leasing, an existing domain name from a private party can be very expensive, and so you are better off buying something obscure like idigfor.gold (currently available for only $101). This is one reason why companies have such strange names these days.

### Amazon Web Services - Route 53
Creating a secure (HTTPS) connection to your application is not possible with just an IP address. `Route 53` is the AWS service that handles everything DNS related. With Route 53 you can buy a domain name, host your domain on their DNS servers, and create DNS records. Now that you own a domain name you can use it to create DNS records that will map domain names to IP addresses (A records) or other domain names (CNAME records). For the purposes of this class, you want your root domain name, and any subdomain of your root domain, to map to the IP address of the web server you created previously. You will need the public IP address for your server. You can get the public IP address by opening the AWS browser console and viewing the details of your server on the EC2 service page.

The additional `NS` and `SOA` type records that were listed for your domain name are important for working with DNS. These records were created automatically for you when you registered your domain name. The name server (`NS`) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server. Those same authoritative name servers are listed with the registrar that you leased your domain name from. That way the authoritative name server can verify that the DNS records and the DNS registration match and are authorized to represent the domain name when defining DNS records. Otherwise a hacker could just add DNS records and take over your domain name. The start of authority (`SOA`) record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.

## Caddy 
Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service. This ability to route requests is called a `gateway`, or `reverse proxy`, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy).

For this course, we use Caddy for the following reasons.

- Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates. This allows us to easily support HTTPS.
- Caddy serves up all of your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All of your early application work will be hosted as static files.
- Caddy acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and start up application services. For example, when a request is made to `simon.yourdomain` Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service.

## HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates
During the first couple decades of the web, it was pretty common for websites to simply use HTTP (non-secure hypertext transport protocol) since it was difficult, non-performant, and expensive to secure the connection. Additionally, most websites just provided access to documents and so it didn't need to protect user's information. Usually, only websites that were doing commerce needed a secure connection. That all changed when computers got faster and the web moved from simple document servers (Web 1.0) to full on web applications (Web 2.0) that accepted information from users and displayed that information within the application. Without a secure connection anyone that had access to the network traffic, at any point, from the user's computer to the server handling the request could easily capture all the data sent in either direction. Remember when we used the console program `traceroute` to show you how many computers your connection goes through. You definitely do not want those computers to have access to your user's sensitive information.

The secure version of HTTP is called Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (`HTTPS`). This is basically HTTP with a negotiated secure connection that happens before any data is exchanged. Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the TLS protocol. TLS is sometimes referred to by a now unsecure predecessor protocol named SSL. TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data. 

Web certificates are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate. Once you have a certificate for your domain name, you can serve the certificate from your web server and then the browser can validate the certificate by using the public keys of the certificate issuer.

Now using a service like Let's Encrypt, and the IETF standard ACME protocol that they pioneered, anyone who owns a domain name, can dynamically generate and renew a certificate for free. This incredible contribution of critical web technology has made the web safer, and more reliable, for everyone.

Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for. When this happens Caddy asks Let's Encrypt to verify that the domain for the requested certificate is actually owned by the requester. Let's Encrypt does that by telling the requester to return a specific digitally signed response for a temporary URL when an HTTP request to the domain is made. Let's Encrypt then makes the HTTP request, and if successful, issues the certificate to the requester.

# HTML = Hypertext Markup Language
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build on. HTML was originally designed to be a publishing format for web documents, or pages. From that original definition web programmers have morphed the web page concept into a web application where a page now represents either a single page application (SPA) or a large group of hyperlinked pages that form a multi-page application (MPA). By itself HTML is amazing, but to create a full web application we will need other technologies to style (CSS) our pages and make them interactive (JavaScript). For now, we will focus on creating the content structure with HTML. Text is valid HTML.

### Elements and tags

HTML `elements` are represented with enclosing `tags` that may enclose other elements or text. For example, the paragraph element, and its associated tag (`p`), designate that the text is a structural paragraph of text. When we talk about tags we are referring to a delimited textual name that we use to designate the start and end of an HTML element as it appears in an HTML document. Tags are delimited with the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols. A closing tag will also have a forward slash (`/`) before its name.

The `head` element contains metadata about the page and the page title. The `body` element represents the content structure. The `main` element represents the main content structure, as opposed to things like headers, footers, asides, and navigation content. When we `render` the HTML in a browser it would look exactly the same as our original simple text example. The reason for that is that HTML is almost completely about structure. 

### Attributes

Every HTML element may have attributes. Attributes describe the specific details of the element. For example, the `id` attribute gives a unique ID to the element so that you can distinguish it from other elements. The `class` attribute is another common element attribute that designates the element as being classified into a named group of elements. Attributes are written inside the element tag with a name followed by an optional value. You can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to delimit attribute values.

```html
<p id="hello" class="greeting">Hello world</p>
```

### Hyperlinks

One of the core features that made the web so successful was the ability to create hyperlinks that take you from one page to another another with a simple click. A hyperlink in HTML is represented with an anchor (`a`) element that has an attribute containing the address of the hyperlink reference (`href`). A hyperlink to BYU's home page looks like this:

```html
<a href="https://byu.edu">Go to the Y</a>
```

HTML defines a header (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file.

### Common elements

Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements. Here is a short list of HTML elements that you will commonly see.

| element   | meaning                                                                |

### Comments

You can include comments in your HTML files by starting the comment with `<!--` and ending it with `-->`. Any text withing a comment block will be completely ignored when the browser renders it.

```html
<!-- commented text -->
```

### Special characters

HTML uses several reserved characters for defining its file format. If you want to use those characters in your content then you need to escape them using the `entity` syntax. For example, to display a less than symbol (`<`) you would instead use the less than entity (`&lt;`). You can also use the entity syntax to represent any unicode character.

| Character | Entity      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &amp;     | `&amp;`     |
| <         | `&lt;`      |
| >         | `&gt;`      |
| "         | `&quot;`    |
| '         | `&apos;`    |
| &#128512; | `&#128512;` |

### HTML Versions

Understanding when different HTML features were introduced helps you know what has been around for a long time and probably supported by all browsers, and what is new and may not work everywhere. HTML is pretty stable, but it is still good to check a website like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#browser_compatibility) or [canIUse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_p) to make sure.

| Year | Version | Features                                  |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTML1   | format tags                               |
| 1995 | HTML2   | tables, internationalization              |
| 1997 | HTML3   | MathML, CSS, frame tags                   |
| 1999 | HTML4   | external CSS                              |
| 2014 | HTML5   | email, password, media, and semantic tags |

### index.html

By default a web server will display the HTML file named `index.html` when a web browser, such as Google Chrome, makes a request without asking for a specific HTML file. For example, when you ask for `https://google.com` in your web browser you will actually get back the HTML for the file `https://google.com/index.html`. For this reason, it is very common to name the main HTML file for your web application `index.html`.

### HTML structure elements
The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application.
Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

![HTML Structure](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/raw/main/profile/html/structure/htmlStructure.jpg)

### Block and inline 
There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element div (division) could have an inline element b in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a p (paragraph) element could have a span to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

## HTML input elements 
The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the form container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. 
The input element represents many different input types. You set the `type` of input with the type attribute.

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

### Validating input

Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the `required` attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

### HTML media elements
The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `audio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`. The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code for render a visual image that can even be animated.

#### Image 
```html
<img
  alt="mountain landscape"
  src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg"
/>
```
#### Audio 
```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

#### Video 
```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"/>
</video>
```
#### Internal media
The internal media elements `svg` (Scalable Vector Graphics) and `canvas` allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML. SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. 

# simon notes html
It is important to test your files before you deploy them to your production environment. 
As I was creating the simon html files, I noticed that they all had the same footer and the same header. Within the header each file contained the 
navigation elements allowing the user to go from page to page. 

# CSS Cascading Style Sheets 

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive, experience. The initial objective of CSS was to simply style the HTML based upon the desires of the user, developer, and browser. In modern web applications CSS styling focuses more on helping the developer create complex renderings of dynamic content that is responsive to the actions of the user and the device the application is rendered on. With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

Functionally, CSS is primarily concerned with defining `rulesets`, or simply a `rules`. A rule is comprised of a `selector` that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more `declarations` that represent the `property` to style with the given `property value`.

![CSS definitions](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/raw/main/profile/css/introduction/cssDefinitions.jpg)

How to associate CSS with HTML
1. Use the `style` attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
1. Use the HTML `style` element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The `style` element should appear in the `head` element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.
1. Use the HTML `link` element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The `link` element must appear in the head element of the document.

Rules cascade down from the highest nodes in the DOM tree to the lowest level. Any declaration property defined at a lower level will override the higher declaration.

CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

![CSS box model](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/raw/main/profile/css/introduction/cssBoxModel.jpg)

By default, the width and height of an element is defined by the width and height of the content box. You can change the `box-sizing` CSS property from the default value of `content-box` to `border-box` in order to redefine the width and height to also include the padding and the border. This often makes it easier to style elements when their visual size matches their actual size.

### CSS Selectors 
- Element Type selectors (ex: `body`, `*` all elements, `h1`, `section`)
- Combinators (ex: `section h2` = all h2 elements that are descendants of section elements.
- Class selector (ex: `p.summary` = select all paragraphs with a class of summary)
- ID selector (ex: `#physics` = ID selectors reference the ID of an element. Prefix the ID with the hash symbol `#`)
- Attribute selector (ex: `p[class='summary']`, `a[href]`, `a[href="./fish.png"]` = allow you to select elements based upon their attributes)
- Pseudo selector (ex: `section:hover` = select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes)

### CSS Declarations 
CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

### Units 
You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, a the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (`px`) or inches (`in`). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (`50%`), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (`25vmin`), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (`1.5rem`) as defined by the root element.

| Unit | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| px   | The number of pixels                                             |
| pt   | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                           |
| in   | The number of inches                                             |
| cm   | The number of centimeters                                        |
| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

### Color 
CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

| Method       | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keyword      | `red`                     | A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)                                                                                                                                            |
| RGB hex      | `#00FFAA22` or `#0FA2`    | Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity                                                                                                                                      |
| RGB function | `rbg(50%, 255, 128, 0.5)` | Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage                                                                                                       |
| HSL          | `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)` | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is. |

## CSS Fonts
The CSS `font-family` property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

There are four major families of fonts: `Serif`, `san-serif`, `fixed`, and `symbol`. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes, san-serif fonts do not. Fixed fonts characters all are the same size. This is useful for lining up text when doing things like coding or display tabular data. Symbol fonts represent non-language characters such as arrows or emojis.

### Importing fonts examples 
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.woff2');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}
```

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
```

## CSS Animation notes and example 
Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the `animation` properties and defining `keyframes` for what the element should look like a different times in the animation.

To make this happen we specify that we are animating the selected elements by adding the `animation-name` property with a value of demo. This name refers to the name of the `keyframes` that we will specify in a minute. The keyframes tell what CSS properites should be applied at different key points in the animation sequence. We also add an `animation-duration` property in order to specify that the animation should last for three seconds.

Now we are ready to create the keyframes. We don't have to define what happens at every millisecond of the animation. Instead we only need to define the key points and CSS will generate a smooth transition to move from one keyframe to another. In our case we simply want to start with text that is invisible and have it zoom into the full final size. We can do this with two frames that are designated with the keywords `from` and `to`.

```css
p {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 20vh;

  animation-name: demo;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
```

```css
@keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
}
```

## Responsive design 
The ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called `responsive design`.

### Display 
The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. The common options for the display property include the following.
| Value  | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none   | Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.                                    |
| block  | Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A `p` or `div` element has block display by default.        |
| inline | Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A `b` or `span` element has block display by default.  |
| flex   | Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.                                                                   |
| grid   | Display this element's children in a grid orientation.                                                                       |

### Viewport meta tag
When smart mobile devices started gaining popularity they began to be used to view websites. However, the websites were optimized for desktop displays and not little tiny mobile screens. To solve this mobile browsers automatically started scaling the website so that it looked better on a small screen. Unfortunately, as web applications started being responsive to the screen size, the mobile browser's scaling got in the way. The solution is to include a meta tag in the head element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```

```

### Float 
The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an aside element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

```css
aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}
```

### Media queries
One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the @media selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.

We can use the `@media` selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  div {
    transform: rotate(270deg);
  }
}
```

## CSS Grid 
The `grid` display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. 
We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS `display` property with the value of `grid` on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The next property, `grid-template-columns`, specifies the layout of the grid columns. In this example we say that we want to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (`1fr`) of the grid width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts for each of the children.

We finish off the grid configuration by saying that we want all rows to be exactly 300 pixels high with the `grid-auto-rows` property and the use the `grid-gap` property to say that we want at least a 1 em gap between our grid items. The finished product is the 9 squares that move as the screen changes size. 

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

## CSS Flexbox
The `flex` display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes. We make the body element into a responsive flexbox by including the CSS `display` property with the value of `flex`. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a flex flow. We want our top level flexbox children to be column oriented and so we add the `flex-direction` property with a value of `column`. We then add some simple other declarations to zero out the margin and fill the entire viewport with our application frame.

## Debudding CSS 
CSS is extremely powerful, but sometimes is can be very frustrating to figure out why your page is not rendering the way that you expect. To help you understand why things are rendering the way that are you can use the browser's developer tool to inspect the CSS properties and visualize the HTML layout. Using the Google Chrome debugger you can access the developer tools by right click on the HTML page element that you want to debug and select the `inspect` option. 
You can change any of the CSS properties, and even add new properties, directly in the debugger. This allows you to see what each property is contributing and change them to see how that impacts the rendering. This is a great way to figure out what CSS works best without having to continually change the CSS file and refresh the browser.

## CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks provide functions and components that commonly appear in web applications. As web developers built more and more web applications they began to use the same patterns over and over. They combined these patterns into a shared package of code and contributed it to the world as open source repositories. This helped not only decrease the time to develop an application, but created a common user experience for the web in general.

### Bootstrap 
The reigning champion for CSS frameworks is Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been supported by an active and vibrant community for over a decade and contains many lessons learned from real world applications. The major downside of Bootstrap is its own success. Because it is so popular, Bootstrap defines the de facto look and feel of websites. This is great for user experience continuity, but it makes it difficult for a website to grab the attention of new users.

You can integrate Bootstrap into your web applications simply by referencing the Bootstrap CSS files from their content delivery network (CDN). You then add the HTML link elements to your head element like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link

## UX design 
Properly considering the user experience (UX) of your application will make all the difference in your success. Focusing first on technology, cost, or revenue tends to lead to an unsatisfying user experience. Instead you want to consider why someone is using your application, how they want to interact, how visually appealing it is, and how easy it is to get something done.
- Design a story 
- Simplicity
- Consistency (using the standard layout) 
- Navigation 
- Application map = all the views to present to the user
- Device controls = Device specific controls such as back, next, and home
- Breadcrumb = A path of the user's walk through the application
- common actions = Direct links to locations based on the current view
- colors = color scheme with primary, secondary, and focus color
- typography
- iconography
- text = limit line length
- Internationalization
- space (white space) 
- interaction
- images
- amination 
- Decision fatigue =  Hick's Law states that the time necessary to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices presented
- device aware (size and orientation) 

# CSS Notes
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive, experience.
A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.
How to associate CSS with HTML
1. use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.
2. use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document
3. use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. Make appear in the head element of the document. 

CSS defines everything as boxes.
![CSS box model](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplilearn.com%2Ftutorials%2Fcss-tutorial%2Fcss-box-model&psig=AOvVaw3AENWOUmJEnV4t_89GoDjw&ust=1677018249930000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCMi4jvmRpf0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

Different ways to add color to CSS: keyword, RGB hex, RGB function, HSL.

There are four major families of fonts: `Serif`, `san-serif`, `fixed`, and `symbol`. A serif is a small stroke attached to the ends of a character's major strokes. Serif fonts have the extra strokes, san-serif fonts do not.


## JavaScript Notes 
Officially known as ECMAScript. Typically JavaScript is executed using an interpreter at runtime instead of compiling it into a machine specific binary at build time. This has the advantage of making JavaScript very portable, but also allows for many errors, such as using an undefined variable. These types of errors commonly only get discovered when the program crashes during execution.
The JavaScript console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console.
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2

How to add JavaScript to HTML:  You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a <script> element, or using by the src attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.
  
Variables are declared using either the `let` or `const` keyword. `let` allows you to change the value of the variable while `const` will cause an error if you attempt to change it. JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometime the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are use to strongly typed languages.
  
JavaScript uses complex rules for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as falsy and truthy evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.
	
# JavaScript type and construct 
JavaScript defines several primitives types.

| Type        | Meaning                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Null`      | The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value. |
| `Undefined` | The type of a variable that has not been defined.          |
| `Boolean`   | true or false.                                             |
| `Number`    | A 64 bit signed number.                                    |
| `BigInt`    | A number of arbitrary magnitude.                           |
| `String`    | A textual sequence of characters.                          |
| `Symbol`    | A unique value.                                            |

Of these types Boolean, Number, and String are the types commonly thought of when creating variables. However, variables may commonly refer to the Null or Undefined primitive. Because JavaScript does not enforce the declaration of a variable before you use it, it is entirely possible for a variable to have the type of undefined.

In addition to the above primitives, JavaScript defines several object types. Some of the more commonly used objects include the following.

| Type       | Use                                                                                    | Example                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Object`   | A collection of properties represented by name value pairs. Values can be of any type. | `{a:3, b:'fish'}`        |
| `Function` | An object that has the ability to be called.                                           | `function a() {}`        |
| `Date`     | Calendar dates and times.                                                              | `new Date('1995-12-17')` |
| `Array`    | An ordered sequence of any type.                                                       | `[3, 'fish']`            |
| `Map`      | A collection of key value pairs that support efficient lookups.                        | `new Map()`              |
| `JSON`     | A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.       | `{"a":3, "b":"fish"}`    |
	
Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.

```js
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```
### conditionals
You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact `if else` representation.

```js
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```

You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not).

```js
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```

## String functions 
| Function    | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| length      | The number of characters in the string                       |
| indexOf     | The starting index of a given substring                      |
| split       | Split the string into an array on the given delimiter string |
| startsWith  | True if the string has a given prefix                        |
| endsWith    | True if the string has a given suffix                        |
| toLowerCase | Converts all characters to lowercase                         |
	
## JavaScript arrow function
Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the `arrow` syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the `function` keyword with the symbols `=>` placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.
Arrow functions also have special rules for the `return` keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```js
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

# JavaScript arrays
JavaScript array objects represent a sequence of other objects and primitives. You can reference the members of the array using a zero based index. You can create an array with the Array constructor or using the array literal notation. The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.
| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop`                   |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function sort an array in place                     | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

	
# JSON 
JSON provides a simple, and yet effective way, to share and store data. By design JSON is easily convertible to, and from, JavaScript objects. This make it a very convenient data format when working with web technologies. Because of its simplicity, standardization, and compatibility with JavaScript, JSON has become one of the world's most popular data formats.
  
JSON document can contain these datatype: string, number, boolean, array, object, or null. Most commonly, a JSON document contains an object. Objects contain zero or more key value pairs. The key is always a string, and the value must be one of the valid JSON data types. Key value pairs are delimited with commas. Curly braces delimit an object, square braces and commas delimit arrays, and strings are always delimited with double quotes.
  
You can convert JSON to, and from, JavaScript using the `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` functions.
```js
const obj = { a: 2, b: 'crockford', c: undefined };
const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
const objFromJson = JSON.parse(json);
```
  
# JavaScript regular expressions (textual pattern mathcers) 
You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```
The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```
  
# JavaScript Rest and Spread 
`rest` syntax allows you to make the last parameter of the function take as many things and combine them into an array. Provides variadic functions. 
```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```
Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following example.
  
```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```

# JavaScript Destructuring
 Destructuring is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.
  
Example one
```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
  
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```
When object destructuring, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object. You can map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.
  
```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

# JavaScript Exceptions
  An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the throw keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime. A finally block that is always called whenever the try block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown. Restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations, do not use as a way to handle normal flows of execution. Fallback pattern: you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.
 
```js
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

# JavaScript Scope 
Scope is the variables that are visible in the current context of execution. There are four different types. 
1. **Gobal** - Visible to all code
1. **Module** - Visible to all code running in a module
1. **Function** - Visible within a function
1. **Block** - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces
Closure = a function and its surrounding state. 

## This

The keyword `this` represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The `this` variable is automatically declared and you can reference `this` anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of `this` depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different context that this can refer to:

1. **Global** - When `this` is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the `globalThis` object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
1. **Function** - When `this` is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running is JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
1. **Object** - When `this` is referenced in a object it refers to the object.

## modules
JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules.

# Document Object Model (DOM) 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML. The browser provides access to the DOM through a global variable name document that points to the root element of the DOM. For everything in an HTML document there is a node in the DOM. This includes elements, attributes, text, comments, and whitespace. All of these nodes form a big tree, with the document node at the top.

# Promises
JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.
The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.
The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

```js
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));

// OUTPUT:
//    Coin toss result: tails
//    Toss completed
```
# Promise example question. 
What does this code print out? 
```js
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('taco');
	resolve(true);
  }, 10000);
});
console.log('burger')
	
p
.then((result) => console.log('shake'))
.catch((e) => console.log('salad'))
.finally(() => console.log('noddle'))

console.log('fries')
	
```
Answer: Burger, fires, taco, shake, noodles 

	
# Async and await 
  
These functions provide a more concise representation then promises. The `await` keyword wraps the execution of a promise and removed the need to chain functions. The `await` expression will block until the promise state moves to `fulfilled`, or throws an exception if the state moves to `rejected`. One important restriction for working with `await` is that you cannot call await unless it is called at the top level of the JavaScript, or is in a function that is defined with the `async` keyword. Applying the `async` keyword transforms the function so that it returns a promise that will resolve to the value that was previously returned by the function. Basically this turns any function into an asynchronous function, so that it can in turn make asynchronous requests.

**async, try/catch version**

```js
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
```
  
## await

The `async` keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The `await` keyword wraps a call to the `async` function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise.
By combining async, to define functions that return promises, with await, to wait on the promise, you can create code that is asynchronous, but still maintains the flow of the code without explicitly using callbacks.
	
## await and async pratice question 
What would the code print out? 
```js
const a = async function() {
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	 setTimeout(() => {
	console.log('D');
	resolve(true);
  }, 10000);
}
	
try {
  console.log(`A`);
  await a();
  console.log(`B`);
} catch (err) {
   console.log(`C`);
} 
```

## Debugging JavaScript
- Console debugging: Insert console.log statements in your code. 
- Browser debugging: Really understand the code as it execute. Go to sources. Select the file. Set breakpoints. Refresh the brower window. 
  
# Simon JavaScript 
- Create the JS file. Then add a reference to it in your html. 
- Create one JS function then test it's functionality. Then add more. 
	
# Some general notes about the midterm 
The CSS property padding puts space around the contect of selected elements 
<div> creates a division element in HTML
The order of the CSS box model is context, padding, border, margin
<ul> is the HTML tag or an unordered list
The DOM textContext property sers the child text for an element 
Valid JSON example = {"x":3}
chmod +x depoly.sh makes a scrpt executable
DNA subdomain example: cs260.cs.byu.edu
CNAME = used to point to another DNA record
Valid JSON always has the key value in double quotes. Undefine is not a value object, but null can be. 
Regex /A|f/i (the i is case insensitive) 
Valid JavaScript object?  {n:1} → key value pairs do not have equal signs
