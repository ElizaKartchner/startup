                    Have you ever struggled to come up with a data idea? Maybe you googled data ideas and found 
                    lists out there that are pages and pages long! How do you know if one of those many ideas is even a good one? 
                    If you want to know if a restaurant is good there are many websites you can look up and see the reviews people who have eaten there have said. 
                    If you want to see if a professor is good, you can go to ratemyProfessor.com and see how many stars they have as well as the good and bad 
                    things about their classes. Why not do the same thing for data ideas?! We are here to the rescue. 
                    Whether you're single and want to impress your new love interest, in a serious relationship and ready to pop the question, or married and want 
                    to create a special anniversary or just spice up the normal night date this website is for you. Here people can submit data ideas and others can 
                    post reviews. Each dating idea will have a rating out of five stars and want others to have to say about it. This way you can be informed and 
                    plan the best dates to romance your significant other.
